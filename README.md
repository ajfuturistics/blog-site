# Blog site

I used NextJs, Typescript, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and Next Auth to create this website. Users can use this to look up blog entries and filter their results by title or category. In the admin interface, which is used to manage blog entries, administrators can also add staff members.

## ENV VARIABLES

- BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
- MONGODB_URI=
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
- NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
- NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL="http://localhost:3000"
